Grace Chapel Church Website
Project Documentation
Project Overview

The Grace Chapel Church Website is a fully responsive, multi-page web application designed to strengthen the church’s digital presence and streamline internal processes. The platform leverages the Web3Forms API as a backend-as-a-service solution to securely collect, store, and manage data such as attendance and contributions—without exposing API keys on the client side.

The website is optimized for mobile, tablet, desktop, and large screens, providing a consistent and accessible experience across all devices.

Problem Statement

Traditional church operations often rely on manual attendance sheets, paper-based contribution tracking, and fragmented member records, which can lead to:

Data loss or inaccuracies

Delayed reporting and insights

Inefficient follow-ups with members and visitors

This project digitizes these workflows to create a modern, secure, and scalable solution for church administration.

Problems This Project Solves

Manual attendance tracking and paper records

Inconsistent member and visitor data collection

Lack of centralized contribution records

No real-time visibility into attendance and engagement

Poor mobile usability on traditional church websites

✔ The solution introduces a centralized, web-based system with automated data submission, validation, and insights powered by Web3Forms.
